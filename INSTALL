You may need to change the 'LIBS' attribute in the 'config' file.
Then in *this directory* type:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

The wonderful MakeMaker will take care of the subdirectories.

The test suite is not complete, nor is the documentation, however, 
if you are familiar with the DCE security APIs and/or have your
reference manuals close by, the *.t files will serve as decent examples.
